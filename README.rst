Simple LaTeX Hack for Very Condensed References
-----------------------------------------------

Usage options:
* clone the repository, test that it is working using ``python3 texcompile.py xtrashort-refs-example``
* copy only the .bst file, then copy-paste relevant lines the .tex file into whatever latex you are already writing.

This was intended as a quick hack example.  I only tested it on my machine, with my Python version and my LaTeX distribution. Your mileage may vary.

Shout-out to @yasmeenasali who helped me figure out how to do this.
