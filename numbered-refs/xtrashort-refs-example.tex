	\textbf{Very Compressed Citations with xtrashort.bst}
\end{center}

\justification

Nobody knows why institutions still force you to compress references and make them smaller font in order to fit on a page. Some institutions have come around to excluding references in page limits, but for those that haven't, there is this bst file. That's a lot of citations in a small space!\citep{akins23, allison91, arras21, atreya20, aurnou07, beebe05, brogan18, lellouch07, sherjal95,  esposito91, teca}!

Hopefully the in-line comments are clear in both this file and in the .bst file, which I modified from apalike.bst. Big thanks to Yasmeen Asali for sharing that she had hacked .bst files for similar purposes before.

Not everything works perfectly yet; something should be done about e.g. conference proceedings like \citep{thatte15} but I didn't want to deal with it.
